*One statistic that we like to look at is U-Haul trends. There are a ton of trucks coming into the city, but few are leaving.*

As you are already aware I’m sure, we have a ton of people moving to the Portland metro area every single year and it seems that number only increases year after year.&nbsp;

One of the ways we determine how many people are moving to the area is by studying U-Haul trends. That’s right, U-Haul does keep data on where people are moving and how much it’s costing them.&nbsp;

The amount of trucks that come to Portland not only show that Portland is a very popular city to move to, but trucks are a little cheaper to rent here as well because there is such a surplus.

If you are thinking of making a move, whether it’s in-state or out-of-state, we would love to help. Give us a call or send us an email with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you!
