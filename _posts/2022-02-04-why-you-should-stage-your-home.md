Should you stage your home? Every real estate agent will tell you yes, but they might not tell you why. Today I want to run through seven benefits of staging your home:

**1\. Functional obsolescence.** This is a fancy real estate term, but it just means that you can show how flaws in your floor plan aren’t really flaws. If you have a challenging floor plan that takes away from your home, staging can help buyers envision how they might use the space.&nbsp;

**2\. You can stand out from your competition.** If you live in an area where most of the homes are similar, staging can make your property stand out.&nbsp;

**3\. It brightens up a blank canvas.** This is especially true for new construction homes. Putting furniture in an otherwise brand-new house will make it feel less sterile and more comfortable.&nbsp;

**4\. It helps with in-person and online viewings.** Statistically, buyers are more likely to view a home if the photos include staging.&nbsp;

**5\. You get more showings.** If your home looks great, more buyers will look at your home, and you’ll receive more high-quality offers. Also, 53% of listing agents report that staged homes sell quicker. This is likely because it encourages buyers to visit your home.&nbsp;

**6\. Staging adds value for your buyers.** Buyers’ agents report that staging is becoming increasingly important for their clients.

**7\. It helps people visualize living in your property.** If buyers can picture themselves living in your place, they’re more likely to overlook small faults.&nbsp;

If you don’t want to go all-in with conventional staging, my team offers another option called a staging consultation. We’ll bring in a staging professional to stage your home using your furniture and décor. You’ll probably have to take down personal photos and make a few changes, but this option is a great way to get the benefits of staging while you still live in your home.&nbsp;

If you have any questions about staging or anything else real estate-related, please call or email me or my team. We are always willing to help.
