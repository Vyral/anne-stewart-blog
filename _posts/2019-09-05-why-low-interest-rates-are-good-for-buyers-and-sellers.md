We haven’t seen interest rates this low in a while, so I wanted to take a few minutes today to explain to why they’re so important. **We’re back to historic low interest rates and that means cheap money for buyers.**

For buyers out there who’ve been considering a move, your buying power just went up substantially.

**And for all the sellers out there, know that these low rates are going to increase the number of buyers we see and keep prices going up.&nbsp;**

We’re not quite sure why this is happening, but if you’re thinking about getting into the market this year, you’ll want to do it while we have these low rates. Even if you just want to refinance, it’s a great time to do that too.&nbsp;

Interest rates fuel our market, don’t kid yourself. It’s not about how fancy our houses are or what upgrades we have, it’s about interest rates. When they go up, the market slows. This happened at the end of 2018. **In 2019, with low rates, it’s the perfect time to take advantage of the opportunity to buy or sell a home.**

If you have any questions for me in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
