If you want to make the most money out of your home sale, there are a few things you need to think about.

I recently heard someone new to the industry talk about how there’s no need to prepare a home, but it’s simply not true. Getting your home ready for sale is the best way to put more in your pocket. However, because every home is unique, I couldn’t possibly give you an all-encompassing list of what to do to prepare.

When I meet with clients, **I’m evaluating their home based on what the market’s doing in their area, as well as their price point.** If the market’s soft, the seller may have to do more to make their house presentable. It may not make it more valuable, **but it will become more salable**. This can be done through inexpensive updates, such as new carpets, fresh coats of paint, etc.

These days, buyers are walking through homes and looking for costly repairs they’d need to make. Freshening up the living areas can go a long way, as the first impression you want to give is one of a well-maintained home. If a buyer walks onto a property and sees old, gnarled carpeting, peeling paint, leaf-filled gutters, and an overgrown yard, their mind begins to race. They think, “If these items are in bad shape, what will the home inspection bring up?” A poorly presented home can easily scare buyers away. **Make them feel secure in writing an offer for your home.**

Stick to the simple and inexpensive stuff—don’t do any major remodeling or updating. You normally won’t get your money back for these pricey improvements anyway. **You simply want to make your home move-in ready, clean, and presentable for potential buyers.**

If you’re thinking about selling, let’s talk. As every house is unique, we can talk about the specific strategies we could use to make your home sell for the most it possibly can. Feel free to reach out to me with any other questions you may have. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
