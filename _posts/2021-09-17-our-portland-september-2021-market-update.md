Today I’m sharing our Portland real estate market update for September 2021. We are back in the throes of the coronavirus, so how does that affect the market? I’ve been listening to and reading up on many relevant economic topics because the delta variant is throwing everything for a loop again. To tell the truth, we don’t know where things are headed because of this, but I can share what I do know.&nbsp;
