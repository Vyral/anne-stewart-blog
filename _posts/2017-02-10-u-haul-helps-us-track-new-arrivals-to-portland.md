As I'm sure you are already aware, we have a ton of people moving to the Portland metro area every single year and it seems that number only increases year after year.&nbsp;

**One way we determine how many people move to the area is by studying U-Haul trends.**U-Haul keeps data on where people move and how much it costs them.&nbsp;

The amount of trucks that come to Portland not only shows that Portland is a very popular city to move to, but trucks are a little cheaper to rent here as well because there is such a surplus.

**If you are thinking of making a move, whether itâ€™s in-state or out-of-state, we would love to help.&nbsp;**Give us a call or send us an email with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you!
