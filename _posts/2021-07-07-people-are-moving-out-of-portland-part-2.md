Today’s blog is part two in my two-part series about people moving to and from Portland and Oregon. Let’s begin by talking about the four feeder states, as we call them. These are the most common states people are moving to when they leave Oregon:&nbsp;

**1\. Arizona.** The largest migration is to Arizona, but we’ve always had many people moving from Portland to Arizona whether it’s for retirement, family, or work (plenty of businesses have a campus both here and there). This year, we’ve also seen a slew of people moving to Arizona because they want to trade their home values, want better weather, and the property taxes are lower.

**2\. Texas.** For the last few years, I’ve seen an array of people moving from here to Texas and from Texas to Portland. It’s a very inexpensive state because taxes are low, and they also get quite a bit of sunshine.&nbsp;

**3\. Florida.** Often people are moving to Portland from Florida to get out of the heat, but lately, we’ve seen a bunch of people moving to Florida from here. Again, it’s super affordable, and they get tons of sun.

**4\. Idaho.** People love to live in Idaho, but the problem over the years has been that there isn’t much industry or jobs, so they couldn’t get the population growth like we’ve seen. However, during the pandemic when people had to work from home, a crowd of them decided to move to Idaho. It’s cheap to live there, and there are numerous outdoor activities you can do in that state. It’s currently the hottest place to move to in the U.S. because they’ve had a 30% to 38% increase in home values in the past five months and have the second-lowest inventory in the country right now.&nbsp;

Now let’s talk about the state people are leaving the most to come to Oregon: California. We’ve always seen a plethora of people moving here from California. I receive a phone call from someone in California every week these days. It’s great that they’re cashing out their homes there and moving here, but they frequently mess with our home price structures. They like moving to Portland and Seattle because they want to stay on the west coast.

**We’re presently in a state of flux;** we’re seeing a swarm of migration both coming and going. The health crisis changed the game for all Americans; they’re rethinking their living situations, where they want to live, how they want to live, the cost of living, and more. If you’re considering making a move, now’s the time to do it.

Reach out to me via phone or email, and let me provide your home’s value, a strategy for your move, or let me answer any questions you have. I hope you’re having a great 2021.
