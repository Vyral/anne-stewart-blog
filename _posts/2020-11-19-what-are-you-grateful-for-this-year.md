&nbsp;

Despite all that’s going on, my team and I believe it’s important to take a minute and think about our gratitude's, even if they seem small this year. I encourage you to think of what you’re grateful for and [read this Declaration of Gratitude](https://vyralmarketing.s3.amazonaws.com/Anne+Stewart/Email+Assets/Gratitude+Declaration.pdf). We have met some truly wonderful people, and we’re proud to have helped so many reach their real estate goals over the years.

We wouldn’t be where we are today without all of your support.

Enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner—that’s what we plan to do\!

In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us if you have any real estate questions. We would be happy to help you.
