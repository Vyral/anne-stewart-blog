If you’re a seller in our market, you have to be prepared to sell your home more than once.&nbsp;

In a market like we’ve been in, where home values have been rising quickly, we’re seeing a lot of challenges in the appraisal world. **Even if you come to an agreement with the buyer on the sale price, you still have to sell that price to the appraiser,** who has to find reasonable comparable properties to suggest they can verify your home’s value so the bank will give the loan to the buyer.&nbsp;

A 1% to 2% difference in your home’s value may not sound like a lot, but it can completely derail a mortgage. This means buyers have to come to the table with more money to make the loan-to-value ratio work. If they don’t have that extra sum, then you have to come down on the list price. If neither party can come together on a price, the deal falls through.&nbsp;

With prices rising and appraisers doing everything they can to justify home values to the banks, we’re seeing a lot of that happen. **In the end, your home’s value has to match what the appraiser agrees to.&nbsp;**
