There are a few things you need to be aware of when selling your home in the winter months. Many people feel the winter is a bad time to sell, so I wanted to debunk this myth with a couple recent stories.

Many sellers don't want to put their home on the market during the winter for a number of reasons. Maybe they don't want to list during the holidays or they have projects around the house they want to get done after the first of the year. The truth is, though, **buyers are still out there looking for a home.**We've even put contracts together on Christmas Eve!

One of the major benefits to selling during the winter is that** inventory is so low that you will have little or no competition.** One of our sellers put their home on the market his holiday season and we had 26 showings during a three-day window. They received multiple offers and sold their home above list price. The sellers had to move and couldn't wait for the spring, which just goes to show that buyers are out there in winter, too. They may be on a timeline or getting relocated for work, for example.

If you or anyone you know is thinking about selling but are waiting for the spring, give me a call or send me an email. We'd love to give you a complimentary analysis and let you know if now is a good time to sell. We look forward to hearing from you!
