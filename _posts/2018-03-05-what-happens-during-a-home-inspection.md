Today I’m going to give you the full rundown of what happens before, during, and after a home inspection. The home inspection is probably one of the biggest things that happens in a real estate transaction, and it’s one of the biggest contingencies a buyer has when doing their due diligence.

**The home inspection gives the buyer an opportunity to find out anything and everything they want to know about a home before they make their purchase final.** The inspection is a contingency, meaning that the buyer can walk away from the transaction at any time if they find something in the inspection they aren’t satisfied with.

When a buyer hires a home inspector to come look at a home, they are going to make note of each and every last detail. The inspection isn’t a pass/fail exam, it’s more like a full physical for your home. A normal inspection report will have around 20 items, but the ones you want to pay the most attention to are the ones that present health and safety issues. Structural health is an important thing to keep an eye on, too.

Most of the things that show up on an inspection report are solvable.&nbsp; If there are specific issues that the buyer is worried about, **we will bring in an expert to give us a better estimate**. For example, if there was an issue with the roof, we would bring a roofing expert in to give a more thorough analysis.&nbsp;

After the inspections are completed and the buyer has had a chance to review the report, they have a decision to make. They could ask you to make some repairs, they could ask for a credit in the sale price to make them on their own, they could walk away from the deal, or they could proceed without asking for anything.

**Every home and every home inspection is different.** All that matters is you have someone on your side who is going to be looking out for your best interests, and there are a variety of ways in which we do this.

If you have any questions for me about home inspections or anything else related to real estate, give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
