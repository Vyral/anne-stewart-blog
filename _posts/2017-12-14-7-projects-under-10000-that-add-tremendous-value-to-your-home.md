If you’re thinking of selling your home anytime in the near future, there are many ways you can increase its value before the time comes. **Here’s a list of seven improvements that typically cost under $10,000 but can add tremendous value to your home when you sell:**

**1. Curb appeal.**What do people see right when they pull up to your home? If you have flaky paint or landscaping issues, those are a few easy areas that you can address on your own. Repainting your front door and baseboards is a good idea too.

**2. Get windows replaced with new vinyl ones.** I’ve talked to many clients who said that doing this saved them a ton on energy costs in the summer and winter.

**3. Open things up.** If you have a kitchen or living room wall that can be knocked out, it’s not an expensive thing to do and really makes a difference. Buyers these days want a sense of openness in a home, and opening up your living spaces is a great way to do that.

**4. Outdoor living spaces**. People want to be able to enjoy all aspects of their home, including the outdoors. If you have room to put in a fire pit, fireplace, outdoor kitchen, or patio furniture, it’s great for your home’s value.

**5. New appliances.** There are a lot of places that offer great deals on new appliances at this time of year. If you’re thinking of selling in the next few months, this is a smart idea. If you need any advice on where to look, just let me know.

**6. Carpet.**Carpet and paint are usually pretty cheap and can really make the house feel brand new. There’s nothing like fresh paint and carpet. It’s like a great little facelift.

**7. Organization.** A lot of people want to see storage space in homes. If you have dead space in your house, maybe in your kitchen, garage, or basement, there is a great opportunity for you to put in some storage bins. People want to know that you have storage space, so if you can open it up, I highly recommend doing that.
