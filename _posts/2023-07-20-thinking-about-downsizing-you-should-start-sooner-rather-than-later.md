Are you considering downsizing? There are many advantages to a smaller living space, but I suggest you don’t wait to make a move. Recently, I held an open house in a 55+ community, and it was packed. On top of that, everyone showed genuine interest in the property; no one was just there to window shop.&nbsp;

**If you are thinking at all about downsizing, you should start the process sooner rather than later.** The truth is that inventory is extremely scarce. Once you finally decide to downsize, it could be a while before you end up in a suitable living area. For example, I’m currently helping a client downsize and relocate, and they’ve found that inventory is much rarer than they thought it would be.

On the other hand, **if you have a main-level living home that you are considering selling, you are in great shape.** Often, I’ve found that main-level living homes sell for more than similar properties that are multiple stories. Older buyers are willing to pay a premium for this feature, so take advantage of it while you can.&nbsp;

If you are considering downsizing at all, please call or email me and my team. We’d love to help you start strategizing to get you into the next home of your dreams.<br>
