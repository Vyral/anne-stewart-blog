Today, I’m here to talk about probate and estates. These terms greatly affect how I sell properties, so I’m here to share some information I believe you should know.&nbsp;

**If you do not have a trust set up for your assets and something happens to you, your assets will sit in probate court** for four to six months until the court system decides who's your next of kin. This process takes time and money, but it can be avoided. It's very simple and relatively cheap to go to an estate attorney and get your assets set up in a trust.

I’m not an attorney and can’t give you legal advice, but I believe it’s helpful to have a trust no matter how many assets you have. If you don’t set one up, your assets will go to probate court, so don’t give the government this chance to take your money. **Set your loved ones up for success.**&nbsp;

Another thing I see in today’s market is guardianship, which is when a minor owns a property for some reason and needs a guardian until they are of age. **No matter which route you take, it’s helpful to designate someone to your property.**&nbsp;

Therefore, this is your public service announcement to take care of your assets and make sure everything is accounted for. Schedule a time to meet with an attorney—it’s well worth it. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out. I can even suggest a good estate attorney, so call or email me anytime, and I would be happy to help you.
