We are currently on the lookout for an individual to join our growing team. We’re a team of doers here at Quinn Stewart Real Estate. **Our team sold over 100 properties last year and the average team member here makes over $100,000 per year, but that’s not what makes us unique.**

What makes us unique is that we all truly care about one another and encourage each other in all aspects of life. We have a spirit of gratitude here, which we share regularly. I don’t think we’d have all the success we have had without those things. The atmosphere of fun, hard work, and success is infectious. We’re a team-oriented company because we all achieve more success together. **We’re here to help each other and support each other every day.**

This is a tough business to try and make it on your own in. One of the great advantages of working on our team is our ability to provide administrative help. When you’re a Realtor who wears a lot of different hats, all the paperwork and marketing stuff can get tiresome. We have specialists on our team that do those things for our agents so they can be out there focusing on their clients. You don’t have to be all things to all people when you work with us. **We have the ability and the systems required to put you in a position where you can focus your time and energy on what you do best.**

This isn’t just a handout. We’re looking for someone who is willing to partner with us and work with the rest of our team in order to be successful. If you or someone you know might be a good fit, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d love to hear from you.

If you have any questions in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you.
