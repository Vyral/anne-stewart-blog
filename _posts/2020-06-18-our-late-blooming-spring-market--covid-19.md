*Summer is the new spring when it comes to real estate this year.*

The spring market this year was delayed compared to previous years, and when it hit, it was very different from what we’d seen before. Now we’re in June, and people have finally started getting comfortable with the idea of carrying out real estate transactions as states have made efforts to flatten the curve.

We’re also able to help safely sell properties. I assure you we’re taking a lot of extra measures to make sure that we keep our clients and agents safe. If you’ve been thinking about selling your home but chose to hold off because of the pandemic, know that **now is the time to consider jumping off the fence.**

We currently have around 2.3 months of inventory, which is low, and that, coupled with the fact that **interest rates are extremely low**, means well-priced homes that are in good condition will likely be snatched off the market.&nbsp;

Other than low interest rates, another reason for the high activity from buyers is that they’re starting to reevaluate their housing situation. Many of us are working from home now, and some companies are considering not going back to a brick-and-mortar office space. A commercial broker and friend of mine indicated that it is a big sign of the changing times that many retail and commercial spaces are never going to really come back from the pandemic. In turn, **many who work from home long-term have begun to think about their own housing circumstances and lifestyles.**

If you’re thinking about selling your home, you should definitely act quickly. Reach out to us by phone or email and we’d be happy to be a resource for you.
