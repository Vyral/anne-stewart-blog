Are you planning to sell your property in 2018? If you are, I’ve got some key tips to share with you today.

First and foremost: Get a strategy going now. **Regardless of when you plan on selling, it’s never too early to start preparing.**

Some people take months to get their homes ready for sale. Sometimes, though, people do much more than is necessary. My team and I met with a couple recently who had literally remodeled their entire house before they put it on the market.

Major renovations might seem like a good idea, but they won’t often bring you the dollar-for-dollar value you’re looking for when you sell. Be sure you talk to a professional before spending a ton of money on preparing your home for sale.

Another aspect to consider when planning your home sale is timing. Despite common belief, spring and summer aren’t the only good times of year to list. **In fact, market conditions right now may be more favorable than if you were to wait a few months.**

Trying to time the market is a dangerous game. I tend to find that timing the market is like buying stocks. Waiting out the market in hopes of a better deal may not be your ideal strategy. If conditions are right for you right now, why wait?
