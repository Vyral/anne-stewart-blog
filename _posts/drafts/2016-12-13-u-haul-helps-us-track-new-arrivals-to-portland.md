The amount of trucks that come to Portland not only shows that Portland is a very popular city to move to, but trucks are a little cheaper to rent here as well because there is such a surplus.

If you are thinking of making a move, whether itâ€™s in-state or out-of-state, we would love to help. Give us a call or send us an email with any questions you have. We look forward to hearing from you!
