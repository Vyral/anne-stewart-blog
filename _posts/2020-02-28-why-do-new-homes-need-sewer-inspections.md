I’m here today at a new construction site to do a sewer scope inspection and I want to explain how this process works in case you ever need this inspection done.

**Essentially, a camera is poked into the sewer line to make sure there are no cracks, breakages, or inclines that would prevent the sewer from working properly.** These lines are typically located within two feet of any crawlspace on a new home.

As a homeowner, you are responsible for what’s going on between your sewer line all the way to the city main. In the past, we’ve had some surprises at this stage, even with brand-new homes, so it’s important to have it done correctly. Sometimes there is more than one drain that we need to check, as was the case in the video above.

The good news is that this scope turned out great, **but the inspector mentioned that a few different new homes he took a look at last week did not.** This inspection is worth every penny at the end of the day.

If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
