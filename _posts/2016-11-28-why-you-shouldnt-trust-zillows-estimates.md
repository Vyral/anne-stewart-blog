*As a professional Realtor, I do not use Zillow for any real estate information. Most of the time, it’s outdated and inaccurate.*

Have you ever gone to Zillow to check your property’s value? A lot of people do, and I get asked about these valuations every week. You can get a lot of data from Zillow, so I understand why people are attracted to the site, but here’s the truth.

As a real estate professional, I do not use Zillow at all for information on homes. I don’t like relying on their algorithms, which are not a true indicator of how your property is doing. If you are thinking about selling soon, I encourage you to reach out to me so I can help you determine what your home is actually worth in today’s market, not Zillow’s interpretation of our market. We can give you an expert opinion on your home’s market value that no website will be able to.
