The key to maximizing what your home can sell for once you put it on the market is following a three-point formula my team and I use that we call “The Trifecta.”

**The first part of this trifecta is marketing.** This is your agent’s responsibility, but unfortunately, a lot of agents get cheap or fail to utilize technology when it comes to marketing. It’s our job to have as many prospective buyers in your area looking at your home, and then to bring those buyers to your front door.

For us, this means marketing online where most consumers are looking for properties. We pay for websites and marketing channels, and we utilize social media in a way that allows people to view your property quicker.

This also includes marketing to other agents as well as buyers. We know that buyers meet with other Realtors every day seeking representation, so if we connect with the real estate community at large, we’ll find the buyers out there who are looking for your specific type of property.

**The second part of the trifecta is condition**. This aspect of the home sale process is one that you as the seller have full control over. You can keep your house messy or clean—it’s your choice. We’d never advise any of our sellers to spend money on their home that they’ll never get back, but there are times when it’s necessary to spend some money in order to get a bigger return on your investment.

**The last part of the trifecta is pricing.** You and your agent should come up with a pricing strategy that will maximize the number of buyers who will look at your home right out of the gate. Your list price should also get these people excited about seeing it. The last thing you want is your home languishing on the market for months on end, enduring multiple price reductions.

Our sellers, on average, sell their homes within the first 30 days of putting them on the market because we focus on all three of these factors. Combining them amounts to creating the perfect storm of buyer interest.

A lot ot sellers are getting their homes ready for the market right now, so if you’d like to know more about what you can do to sell your home for top dollar, don’t hesitate to reach out to us. We’d love to help you.
