Are you thinking about selling your house this winter? I’m a 20-year vet in the real estate industry, and I’ve seen tons of homeowners go through this process. Selling in the winter doesn’t have to be difficult. Here are four tips for those who plan on selling during the winter season:

1. **Get mentally prepared.** Think about when you want to sell. Do you want to sell during the holidays? Maybe that means you won’t decorate as much. Maybe you need to clean the yard differently than you would in the spring. Assess how you will go about this process, and make sure the house looks its best because the inside of the house will matter even more than the outside in the winter.
2. **Repair and replace.** If you’ve been meaning to change the furnace filter, clean caulk and grout, or paint a wall, now is the time to do so. I can advise you on which things you truly need to focus on, so don't waste your time and energy on unnecessary things.
3. **Declutter and clean.** Start looking at your house through the eyes of a buyer. Prospective buyers don’t want to see your personal mementos and photos. Remove those first, then use the rule of 50. Take 50% off of the walls and 50% off the countertops. This will minimize and clean the space so buyers won’t be distracted.
4. **Staging.** Make sure every space is looking its best. We can even arrange to fill the house with consistent-looking furniture.
