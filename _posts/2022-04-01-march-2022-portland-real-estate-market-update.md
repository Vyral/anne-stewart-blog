What happened this month in real estate? Let’s take a look…

Interest rates jumped the highest they have in 3 years to 4.5-5%, which could bring this housing market frenzy to a close. **This was the largest jump within a week in over a decade\!**

**One year ago today, interest rates were at 2.65% and now they're at around 4.8%, that’s double from a year ago.&nbsp;**

The question here is will 5% be a common percentage for us. If that’s so, someone who put down a 20% downpayment on a $585,000 home will see their mortgage payment jump by as much as 10%.

How does inflation play into all this? **It has not yet shown that buyers are reacting in a different way–housing is still in demand**. Buyers are even accelerating their plans and increasing their bids in an effort to close on a loan before rates go higher.&nbsp;

Since we’re at the beginning of the spring shopping season, **there’s also an ongoing shortage of houses which is why we’re seeing demand still so strong.&nbsp;**

Here at Stewart Real Estate Group, we are watching every economic indicator and tracking inflation and interest rates very closely, but as of right now we say **get it done\!** We don’t know what the future holds, so now is the best time.<br><br>If you have any questions about this market update or real estate in general, feel free to call or email me. I would love to hear from you.
