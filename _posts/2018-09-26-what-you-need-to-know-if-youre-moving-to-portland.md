If you're looking to come to the Portland area and buy a home, there are some things that you need to be aware of. This is why today I want to tell you all about Portland and what the process of relocating here looks like.

The first thing to know is that **Portland is a big, small city**. Compared to other metropolitan areas, Portland is actually pretty small, but it's spread out. This is why it's important to know where you want to look for a home because neighborhoods can differ so greatly in terms of school districts and walkability.

I recently received an email from a client moving to Portland from abroad. They wanted to live in a metropolitan area because they're used to walking to shops and getting around by bike. Living in the downtown area may be the perfect fit for them.

However, everybody is different. Some people may want a certain school district while others are looking for an older, cuter home on the east side. Others still will focus on the commute to work. You need to understand what you like to do and what you would like to be close to. Do you like the suburbs or do you like to be in the city?

**Portland has become so popular that the traffic has gotten out of control** and it's probably not going to get any better in the near future. For this reason, I always caution those commuting to be aware of commute time. If you know what you want your lifestyle to look like and you know what type of commute you want, it's important to start from there. If you come from a bigger city where you're used to waiting in your car for an hour to an hour-and-a-half, then maybe it's not such a big deal.

Depending on your price point, though, we may have to look outside of the Portland metro area because **affordability has decreased**. If you're conservative and sensitive about your price points and are looking for a certain type of home, sometimes we do have to go further outside of the city to find it.

If you have any questions about moving to Portland, or if you're ready to talk about buying and selling, please feel free to reach out to me. I look forward to speaking with you soon.
