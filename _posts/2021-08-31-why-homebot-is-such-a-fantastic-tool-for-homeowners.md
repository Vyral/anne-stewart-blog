I’m excited to share a free resource that’s going to help you track the value of your home, the homes around you, and much more. It’s called [Homebot](https://homebot.ai/), and I’ve tested it myself quite a bit. It won’t replace the instincts of a local broker with boots on the ground, but it is a fantastic tool that will empower you as a homeowner and help you reach your goals.
