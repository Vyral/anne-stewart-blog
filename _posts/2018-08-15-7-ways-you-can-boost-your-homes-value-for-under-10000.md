Here are seven ways you can add to your home’s value while spending less than $10,000:

**1. Amp up the curb appeal.** When someone pulls up to your house, what do they see right away? If the answer is flaky exterior paint, a drab front door color, or “meh” landscaping, you should spend some time improving those areas. Colored front doors, for example, are all the rage right now, and I’m seeing people get more creative than just the plain old black, white, or red ones we’re used to seeing. Enhancing your home’s exterior makes a big difference in terms of &nbsp;value and its impact on buyers.

**2. Replace your current windows with vinyl windows.** This can improve your home’s energy efficiency and save on utility costs.

**3. Open up a room.** For example, if you have a kitchen that has an adjoining wall that, if taken down, could open up to a living room or a dining room, take it down and open that space up. One thing buyers really want to experience when they walk into a house is openness.

**4. Add an outdoor living space.** We’re seeing a big trend of people wanting to experience their house on the outside, so to speak. If you have a yard where you can install a firepit, an outdoor kitchen, or a seating area with some ambiance and livability, try converting that space.

**5. Get new appliances.** New appliances make a home feel refreshed. And honestly, who doesn’t love new appliances? I just bought some new appliances for my house, and there are many places you can go that offer great deals for them.

**6. Install new carpet/Add a fresh coat of paint.** These are the two things I advise most often to people who are preparing their home for the market. They’ll make you feel like your home just got a facelift.

**7. Improve the home’s organization.** Many people value use of space and knowing that they haves areas to put their belongings. I recommend giving your home an audit to see if there’s any dead space that can be converted into storage space.
