Right now, one of the biggest search questions on Google is, “When is the housing market going to crash?” While we probably aren’t heading for a crash, I think a lot of people can tell the market is shifting a little. Today, I’ll go over in detail my top three reasons why the market may be cooling off.&nbsp;
