Every week I get asked about friends, family, clients, “What is the market doing?” The market has been hot, hot, hot, and if you’ve bought or sold a home in the last 18 months, you’ve probably sensed that.&nbsp;

There’s a lot of discussion about where the market is going. I can give you all kinds of responses that I have heard, or that I think is happening, but if you’ve watched any of my real estate videos in the last few months you may have seen that the real estate market is trending. Where is it going though?

**I want to hear from you.&nbsp;**There is a form down below and it takes you to a series of questions. I want to know what you think. Do you think it will continue to rise? Do you think it will level out, or drop? What do you think the stock market will do? What do you think the real estate market will do?

If you fill out the form below, I’m going to share it on my next video. I have my opinions about the market, but maybe you’re a business owner or you’ve been studying the market on your own have your own opinions about where it’s headed. We want to know what you think.

If you have any other questions or you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please give me a call or shoot me an email. I’d be happy to help!
