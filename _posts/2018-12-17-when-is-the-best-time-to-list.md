People often ask us when the best time to list a home is.

Well, while this depends heavily on what is most appropriate for your specific circumstances, **there are certain seasonal benefits to consider as you think about your real estate goals.**

While many say that spring is the absolute best time of year to list, this isn’t the truth. There are many benefits to listing toward the end of the year, as well.

Not many people want to list during the winter months. They’re busy with family, the weather isn’t often the best, and they likely see the season as an “off” time for the market. However, this line of thinking actually presents a huge opportunity for those who are willing to list during the later months. **The fewer people willing to list, the less competition those who do will face.**

That’s right—listing during the winter gives sellers the unique opportunity to stand out from the crowd. Better yet, there is often a surge of eager buyers entering the market after the first day of the new year. Sellers who are already prepared to list, or who already have their home on the market at this time, are therefore at a major advantage.

These buyers also tend to be very serious about making a move. They wouldn’t be on the market if they were simply curious about what’s available, as is sometimes the case with buyers who browse in the spring and summer.

Your flowers may not be in bloom and your landscaping may not be perfect during these colder months, but getting ahead of the market is an incredible strategy for sellers who are ready to make a deal.

The first and second quarter are the most active times of the year for our real estate market. **Why not start preparing now and get an edge on the competition you would face if you waited until spring?** Our team would be happy to guide you through the process.
