The real estate market has changed. In 2024, we need a smarter approach to sell your home for the best price. It's your job as a seller to attract buyers because you want the most buyers looking at your home that are qualified and vetted and ready to consider buying you. Here are some things you need to seriously consider:

**1\. Condition.** How you present your home to a buyer is extremely important. When a buyer sees your house for the first time, they're already forming opinions. Make sure your landscaping looks neat, your front door is inviting, and the exterior is well-maintained. Inside, your house should be clean. Consider staging to show off your home and help buyers imagine themselves living in your home.

**2\. Fix home issues before showings.** Buyers today are picky and don’t want a house with problems. It is smart to do a pre-inspection to fix issues before buyers see them. Hire professionals to fix issues like a rotting back deck, drainage, or mold issues since buyers are going to ask you to correct those to avoid surprises that could make a buyer walk away.

**3\. Offer financial incentives.** In a slower market, you might need to sweeten the deal. Could you offer to pay some closing costs? Maybe help with the interest rate? Or cover some HOA fees? These offers can make your home more attractive to buyers who are watching their budgets closely.

**4\. Price it right.** Your asking price is your best marketing tool. A good price attracts more buyers, which often leads to a better sale. Pricing too high and sitting on the market for a long time usually doesn't end well. Remember, we want to sell for the most money, in the least time, with the fewest headaches.

Be adaptable as we continue to deal with market changes, and remember these four tips to attract the right buyer and get the best deal possible. If you need some advice, we are just a phone call away if you need to talk about your situation specifically.
