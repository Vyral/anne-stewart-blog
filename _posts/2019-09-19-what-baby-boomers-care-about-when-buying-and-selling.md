With about 10,000 baby boomers retiring every single day across the United States, it’s no wonder why this demographic constitutes such a large portion of buyers and sellers in our national real estate market.&nbsp;

If you, yourself, are among this massive group of buyers and sellers, then it’s time to connect with a Realtor. You’ll need a strong professional by your side, whether looking to downsize, relocate, or simply move to a home with fewer maintenance requirements.&nbsp;<br><br>{% include pullquote.html %}

One popular option for boomers is to move back in with their adult children. This reduces the cost of living for everyone involved. Generational living is also beneficial for baby boomers with health issues, who may find it difficult (or even dangerous) to live on their own.&nbsp;

For those who have the desire and ability to remain independent, though, there are many other cost-effective options that your agent should be able to direct you to. This includes 55+ communities, condos, and other such properties. As you consider your options, think not only about your wants and needs, but also your financial capacity. And don’t forget to think about your tax situation.&nbsp;<br><br>If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.
