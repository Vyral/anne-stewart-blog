If I was looking to hire a real estate agent, I would be looking for these things very specifically. I think it’s really important for people to understand this list because these factors are critical and essential to the success of a transaction. **Here’s my list:**

**1. Communication.** A high level of communication is absolutely necessary. It’s the premise in which we determine how we talk about the process, transparency, and all the things that go along with it. We pride ourselves on regularly touching base with our clients so they know exactly what’s happening, even if nothing’s happening. We prefer to over-communicate instead of under-communicating.&nbsp;

**2. Experience.** There is a flood of new agents in our marketplace.The reality is that a lot of these agents have zero experience with the mistakes that can be made and end up costing their clients thousands of dollars. These agents do a disservice to their clients by not having enough experience. An experienced agent will know the ins and outs of a transaction, know who to call if they need a vendor, and help the transaction move along smoothly.&nbsp;

**3. Negotiations.** We are professional negotiators and we’re hired to negotiate terms and price and the entire process through. A lot of people do not know how to negotiate properly when it comes to pricing, repairs, and more. This is a critical piece to the puzzle.

If you have any questions about any of these things or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
