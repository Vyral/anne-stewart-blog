{% include youtube.html %}<br><br>Clients often ask us how to competitively price their home.&nbsp;

**One of the best ways to do so is actually to schedule a seller orientation appointment with us so that we can perform a market analysis.** In short, we’ll examine data from currently listed and recently sold comparable homes in your area to determine how much your own property could net.&nbsp;

**Once we’ve done this, we’ll have a conversation with you about what price you think is fair.** When it comes time to list, we’ll proceed with what we call “testing the market.” In essence, we’ll list your home at the price you’ve chosen to see how the market responds. If the response is positive after five or six showings, we’ll usually get an offer within the first seven to 10 days.&nbsp;

And if the price isn’t as effective as you would have hoped, we can always adjust it to maximize your success moving forward.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to talk about the value of your home, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
